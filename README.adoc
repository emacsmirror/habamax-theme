== Make it better

I don't use that much major or minor modes and some colors or lack of it in your favorite mode might be really unpleasant.

So tailor the theme according to your aesthetics (try not to make it too fancy) then

. make a pull request
. attach a screenshot :)

and most probably, like in 99% I will accept it.
